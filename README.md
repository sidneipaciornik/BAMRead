Plugin to read specific 3D file formats

This code was developed a while ago by other people, no longer available. It is a FIJI/Imagej plugin that reads 3D image files stored in specific format used at the BAM research center, in Germany.

I am trying to integrate this plugin with Drag and Drop functionality provided by FIJI to other file formats.
